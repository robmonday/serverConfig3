##Summary of Software Installed and Configuration Changes Made

1. Created VM with Udacity account, SSH into server

1. Updated all currently installed packages ("apt-get update", "apt-get upgrade")

1. Changed the SSH port from 22 to 2200 ("nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config", changed port in code number using editor, "service ssh restart", "exit", "ssh -i ~/.ssh/udacity_key.rsa root@52.33.143.150 -p 2200")

1. Configured Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow specified incoming connections ("ufw default deny incoming", "ufw default allow outgoing", "ufw allow ssh", "ufw allow http", "ufw allow www", "ufw allow ntp", "ufw allow 2200", "ufw deny 22", "ufw status" to check results)
